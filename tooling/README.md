### Code Hygiene 

#### [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action)

When I first pushed this repo and make it public, though I thought I'd checked everything, I exposed a minor, but still sensitive, credential.
Luickly it was caught inside of a couple days and no harm was done. But it's a reminder that these things can't be left at good intentions and
*almost* good enough. Automation to the rescue. ðŸ¤–
