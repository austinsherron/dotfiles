# dotfiles

My "dotfiles", or to the uninitiated like myself, the configuration files that drive the look, feel, and behavior of the tools I use everyday.

These files are very much a work in progress--as they always should be, I think!--as I've just started to conceptualize them as a "project" in
and of themselves. ðŸ™ƒ

## My Setup

These files are shared across two laptops: my work computer, a 2023 M3 MacBook and my personal laptop, a System76 Darter Pro running Pop!_OS. 

Most of these configs, especially the Neovim files, were developed while I took some time away from working, so they've been developed and tested only on my personal Linux machine. I'm starting a new role that's going to require me to install these configs on a MacBook for the first time in a while, so that's certainly going to be a challenge. ðŸ˜…

### Active Work

#### [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action)

When I first pushed this repo and make it public, though I thought I'd checked everything, I exposed a minor, but still sensitive, credential.
Luckily it was caught inside of a couple days and no harm was done. But it's a reminder that these things can't be left at good intentions and
*almost* good enough. Automation to the rescue. ðŸ¤–

#### [yadm](https://yadm.io)/[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/command-overview)

I'm considering adopting an OOB tool to handle environmental deviations in my dotfiles. Yadm and Chezmoi seem like good choices, so I'm starting to explore each of those.

### Paused Work

- [ ] [Xplr](https://github.com/sayanarijit/xplr) - love the concept, but haven't been able to devote enough time to really make it my own/incorporate into daily workflows

### Future Work

All kinds of stuff! But in all seriousness:

* I'd like to play around with [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior) and [Timewarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/timewarrior)
* I like keeping the "source of truth" of my dotfiles outside of their natural structure in the system, i.e.: `~/Workspace/dotfiles/*` instead of `~/.config/*` or `~/.*`, but I also want some system to keep them deployed, synced, and up to date across systems
  * I'm looking at [dotsync](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotsync), but that's only one piece of the puzzle
  * Keep your eye on TODO for an evolving idea I have involving symlinks and a cron (or a new tool I've found called [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr)) (or a systemd path unit)
* I'm pretty comfortable in the Bash universe, but I've heard good things about [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org), and I've always had a fascination with [Fish](https://fishshell.com). I may try my experiment with some other shells in the near-mid term, but a wholesale shell migration *feels* like it would be a large undertaking
* After I had to wipe my personal laptop due to a bad linux install, it occurred to me that my process for setting up a new system is painfully manual (also an issue when trying to sync installed software b/w multiple laptops)
  * I'm thinking of exploring [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) to make this significantly (I think...) easier
* I'd like some mechanism to live sync b/w machines shared state not suitable for a git repo, i.e.: DBs for tools like zoxide, code templates, etc.
  * I don't think I'd get much pushback on the idea that something like the DB instance that backs a zoxide installation doesn't belong in a git repo, but I may get some on the idea that code templates don't 
  * That pushback may be warranted, but at the very least, if templates do belong in a repo, I think it should be repo other than the one managing my dotfiles/IDE (in this case, nvim)
