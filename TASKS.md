## To-Do

### `tmux`

- [ ] Investigate incorporating at least pieces of oh-my-tmux

## Done

### `tmux`

- [x] Install and configure resurrect
- [x] Install and configure continuum
- [x] Make status bar even slightly useful, and please, for the love of god, make it prettier ðŸ¤¬ (on going process)
- [x] Update left portion of status bar to show [# of] panes in active window and indicate which pane is active. **Note:** Edits in [] (square brackets)
- [x] Incrementally upgrade from 3.0a toward 3.3a to see if there's a newer version that doesn't have 3.3a's issues w/ tpm (upgraded to 3.2a, which doesn't have the aforementioned issues)
- [x] If there's a new enough version that doesn't have the tpm bug, remove the root tmux conf file (`~/.tmux.conf`)
- [x] Since upgrading from 3.0a to 3.2a, check if I can uncomment some/all of the tmux conf lines I had to to temporarily remove after the downgrade from 3.3a
- [x] Fix resizing shortcuts
- [x] Add shortcut for "renaming" panes
- [x] Tmux has "randomly" started straight up failing. It's just broken: it exits as soon as it starts (ended up being an issue w/ the resurrect/continuum plugins: the last state file saved was corrupted; the solution was to remove the last state file and relink the next to last to the "last" symlink
- [x] Add layout/resize scripts and integrate them w/ client resize hooks
